## Data
This folder is divided into different subdirectories. Each one contains the data for a different experiment run. It also contains the graphs and jupyter notebooks used for graphics generation. 

## painlessMesh
This folder is deciated to the code we used for the project. While the router table entries varied for different trails and experiments, the structure of the table remained the same.

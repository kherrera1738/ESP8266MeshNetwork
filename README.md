# ESP8266MeshNetwork
Here you can find the code for our mesh network project and our data as well.

## Data
This folder is divided into different subdirectories. Each one contains the data for a different experiment run. It also contains the graphs and jupyter notebooks used for graphics generation. 

## painlessMesh
This folder is deciated to the code we used for the project. While the router table entries varied for different trails and experiments, the structure of the table remained the same. 

## sendData
This contains some code that was used to test the mesh network using different libraries. The code in these folders is different from what was done in the final coding for the project tests.
